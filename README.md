### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mattchenevenup
### What is this
This is inspired by Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to read it â€” or even provide feedback on it! This is a living document and will be a README on git somewhere. So hi! Letâ€™s get to know me. 
Note: 'You' in this document is you the engineer/manager/lead.

### My Background
I am an engineer turned engineering manager. I have worked at various stage start-ups (YC-Alum exits WePay and late stage companies) as well as large global companies like Amazon and Netflix and Goldman Sachs. I have been in Cloud Technologies, Financial Services, Entertainment and Streaming etc.

### How to Reach Me
- It's always ok to huddle on Slack (I built part of it :-) and love the features) or send me a Google Meet link to join
- Send me a direct slack, with `urgent` sign, and I will respond immediately, otherwise, I will try best to reply in a few minutes/hours
- Send me a group chat with @matt.chen so I can respond quickly
- I will usually scan all groups/emails by EOD
